# To do list

This app was designed to manage temporary data. It uses * localstorage * as storage, so while it is persistent some of the time, it is not a permanent storage. It is more a proof of concept rather than a finished app.

It is built using * typescript * and uses gulp and * browserify * as a task runner and module bundler. The HTML is built using * pug * javascript templating language.

# Notes
- Download or clone the project
- Install all dependencies using * npm install *
- Run * gulp watch * to start building the project or run * gulp build * to just build the HTML, CSS and javascript files in the * build * folder.
